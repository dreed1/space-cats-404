In the beginning, I had been itching to photoshop my cat into a spacesuit. Then came the idea for a 404 page where I can control my my catstronaut. Lazors were a logical addition. By this point, I needed something to shoot... pizzas filled an important need. I'm not sure when it became a game exactly but I think with the addition of a healthbar, lives and a score it now qualifies as such.
