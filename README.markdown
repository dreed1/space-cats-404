###This page puts a catstronaut in your browser. Control him with your arrow keys, shoot LAZORS with the space bar. 
###Try to kill the floating pizzas!

#DISCLAIMER: i haven't actually done the leg work for the collision detection, you'll only be able to *try* to kill the pizzas.

Use this project for whatever you want, it'd tickle me pink if anyone actually pulled this into their project.
